        <p>I'm a drinking artist with a huge modular synthesizer problem. My passion for creating unique sounds has led me down a rabbit hole of endlessly tweaking knobs, patching cables, and experimenting with different modules. There's something magical about the way that modular synthesizers can produce complex and unpredictable sounds, and I love the challenge of trying to tame them into something musical.
            Of course, my obsession with synthesizers has its downsides. I've spent more money on modules than I care to admit, and my studio is starting to resemble a jumbled mess of wires and blinking lights. But despite the challenges, I wouldn't trade my synthesizer addiction for anything. It's a never-ending journey of discovery and experimentation, and I'm excited to see where it takes me next.</p>

      <p>I also develop web applications, and it's a completely different type of creative challenge. While my work as a drinking artist allows me to explore the depths of sound and music, web development requires me to think about user experience, design, and functionality. It's a constantly evolving field, and there's always something new to learn.
        As a web developer, I have to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends. From front-end frameworks like React and Angular, to back-end languages like Node.js and PHP, there's a lot to keep track of. But the reward is in seeing my creations come to life on the web, and knowing that I'm helping to build a better digital world. Whether it's a simple website or a complex web application, I'm always excited to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.</p>

      <p>I also live with my wife and cat Dixie. They are my constant companions and bring a lot of joy to my life. Dixie is a mischievous cat with a playful personality. She loves to curl up on my lap while I work or play music, and she always finds a way to make me smile.
        Living with my wife has also been an incredible experience. We share many interests, including music and art, and we enjoy spending time together exploring new places and trying new things. She is my biggest supporter and source of inspiration, and I feel fortunate to have her in my life.     
        Together, the three of us make a happy little family. Whether we're enjoying a quiet night in or embarking on a new adventure, I know that I can count on my wife and cat to be by my side.</p>
